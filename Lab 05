import java.util.Scanner;
/*
nextBoolean()	Reads a boolean value from the user
nextByte()	Reads a byte value from the user
nextDouble()	Reads a double value from the user
nextFloat()	Reads a float value from the user
nextInt()	Reads an int value from the user
nextLine()	Reads a String value from the user
nextShort()	Reads a short value from the user

- Example -
float num;
num = scanner.nextFloat();
or
float num = scanner.nextFloat();
Lab- User Input - Medical Form

For this assignment you will practice getting user input in Java.

Declare a Scanner object to be able to get information from the user.

Assume you are hired by hospital Texas General, and they've tasked you to create a program to collect user information to save paper.

Get and store the user's name. (Store as text)
Get and store the user's age. (Store as a whole number)
Get and store the user's weight. (Store it as a real number)
Get and store if the user is a smoker. (Store it as either true or false)
Output all of the information back to the user.
